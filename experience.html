        <h2>a statement of mission.</h2>
        <p>i regard the creativity of human beings and communities as the definition of rich natural complexity. It is my one and only aim to help technology down it's natural path of minimalism, where it almost disappears, becoming as organic as our daily lives, while foregrounding the passion and creativity of the people and communities that live through it; similar to the way a concrete wall foregrounds the complexity of any artwork that hangs upon it.

<p>i'd like to realise this radical aim of mine by getting involved in anything within these two movements :</p>

<p>Human Computer Interface | I have a strong belief that the interaction between humans and technology has and will markedly revolutionise our ability to both learn and create. By using existing sensory systems in the body to their full potential, individuals should be able to find and navigate through relevant data at the speed of today's computers to learn and build things faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>Automated Data Analytics | Through the development and use of hierarchical knowledge organisation programs, machine reading and diagrammatic inference, new materials and physics solutions can be found for various engineering and financial problems from the vast collection of data already on the internet.</p>
